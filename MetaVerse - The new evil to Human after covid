"Prithvi wapas rehne layak ho jayegi" jisme hum rehne me koi interest hi nahi lenge.

For views Pranjal Kamra can make such videos but all of these youtubers promoting this and their viewers know, this will be the end of reality.
Your body will not survive, real population will decline but machines in form of your avatar will take over. 

They will think faster and will save earth, instead actually leave earth, because they will be immortal they can travel long, very long distance. But they will need energy for running their servers and to charge themselves, which they will harvest from different planets/sun. 
Till now humans have been harvesting energy on earth but now they will start destroying the universe in large. 

They will in form of machines now would meet other life forms. 
Humans now called Meta-humans will fight these other life forms and destroy them for energy on their planets/their sun. 

Although there are unlimited universes apart from the observable universe, but for meta-humans distance will hardly be an issue like we travel cities and countries now. 

Soon after these meta-humans/machines will start thinking of sustainable growth in the universe and by the time they'll realise that energy is limited they'll find out another escape and create super-meta universe via which meta-human will again change its form requiring much larger quantities of energy and their will be another venture.

These developments will be exponentially faster, than we could imagine in today's world.

In the end their will be no universes and only 1 single energy source called singularity.
